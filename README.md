# EC601_Miniproject_2
This project is to distinguish dogs from hot dog using machine leaning model. 

Please run this file in Python3.6 and make sure that you have all the packages below before you run:
- tensorflow
- numpy
- openCV

Before you run, please download a folder called mini2  from my googledrive where I uploaded the required pictures, and save the two files(train.py & pic_process.py) in the folder. (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xsg0t3JgLLb0cTTvpiRlpTSsz_Lg0JB4/view?usp=sharing)

I choose around 80% pictures from each catogaries as training set and the rest as testing set. 

The accuracy turns out to be 85%.
